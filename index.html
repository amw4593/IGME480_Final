Established in the late 19th century as a merger between the Rochester Athenaeum and Mechanics Institute, the campus quickly became a hub for technical education and applied arts. By the mid-20th century, as the institute expanded, the need for a larger, more modern campus led to the relocation to Henrietta in 1968. The original site didn't fade into history, though — it evolved into what is now known as the Bevier Building, part of RIT’s College of Art and Design presence in downtown Rochester, honoring long - time supporter Susan Bevier.");

Students from across the world log in to this always-on environment, exploring its neon-lit corridors through AR, VR, and neural interfaces. The towering structure isn’t just a building—it’s the core of a global learning network. With each glowing key on its side representing an active user node, this new RIT is a living server, syncing minds in real time across continents.!");
